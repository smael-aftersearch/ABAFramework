# Required tests in the generated project

## Implemented tests

- `tests/Aba.Starter.Api.Tests/ApiSmokeTests.cs`: generated OpenAPI, Scalar documentation route, health and correlation header using WebApplicationFactory.
- `tests/Aba.Starter.Api.Tests/SecurityGuardTests.cs`: required OIDC config for non-development runtime, explicit local exception.

## Commands

```bash
dotnet restore Aba.Starter.slnx
dotnet build Aba.Starter.slnx -c Release --no-restore
dotnet test Aba.Starter.slnx -c Release --no-build
```

## New changes

Each feature needs relevant success, negative and invariant tests, and updated API/contract docs. For a new context, implement unit and integration tests before adding broader end-to-end tests. Add real PostgreSQL, Redis, Wolverine, tenant isolation and provider failure tests only when their adapters exist; never claim they already run.
